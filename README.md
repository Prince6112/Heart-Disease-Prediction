# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Project on Heart Disease Prediction in collaboration with SRM medical 

## Objective
To predict whether a patient is at risk for a heart attack. This is a binary outcome.
Positive (+) = 1, patient is at risk Negative (-) = 0, patient is not at risk

## Understanding the Dataset
age (#)
sex : 1 = Male, 0 = Female (Binary)
(cp) chest pain [type (4 values, Ordinal)]: 1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic
(trestbps) resting blood pressure (#)
(chol) serum cholestoral in mg/dl (#)
(fbs) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (Binary) [1 = true; 0 = false]
(restecg) resting electrocardiographic results [values 0,1,2]
(thalach) maximum heart rate achieved (#)
(exang) exercise induced angina (Binary) [1 = yes; 0 = no]
(oldpeak) = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (#)
(slope) of the peak exercise ST segment (Ordinal) [ 1: upsloping, 2: flat , 3: downsloping)
(ca) number of major vessels (0-3, Ordinal) colored by fluoroscopy
(thal) maximum heart rate achieved (Ordinal) [3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect]
